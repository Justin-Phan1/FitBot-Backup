# Repo for a deep learning model created with Pytorch in Python, Flask, and React. 

## This repo contains the code for this project to be hosted on the web using a hosting service but I have encountered many issues with finding services that support easy Flask deployment and was unable to deploy this project on the web successfully.

# I am saving this repo for the future if I learn of a free and efficent way to deploy my Flask app.
